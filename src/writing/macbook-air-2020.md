I have started this long term review on 24th May 2020 and I will update it over time based on my findings, what issues cropped up, what can be improved, and useful tips and hints.

## The Specs

My previous MacBook was the mid 2014 15" Retina Macbook Pro containing the following spec:

+ Intel i7 2.2ghz quad core - Turbo Boost up to 3.4GHz
+ 16GB of 1600MHz DDR3L memory
+ 512GB flash storage

If we are going to be talking graphics card, it contained the Intel Iris Pro Graphics and NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M (2GB GDDR5). I have to point out that gaming was doable on this laptop, although I highly recommend splashing out the cash on a proper gaming rig and be done with it.

The weight of the MacBook Pro 15" was at a hefty 2.02kg (4.46 pounds). It was a fairly heavy device to be carting around and it was not fun to carry on long train journeys.

Let's talk about the MacBook Air, I opted for the following specs:

+ Intel i5 1.1GHz quad-core - Turbo Boost up to 3.5GHz
+ 16GB of 3733MHz LPDDR4X memory
+ 512GB flash storage
+ Intel Iris Plus Graphics (eGPUs supported via Thunderbolt 3)

The weight? 1.19kg (2.8 pounds). I agree that it is not a fair comparison because this is an Air not the Pro. The current 16" MacBook Pro weight 2.0 kg (4.3 pounds) and containing such monster specs. It is an incredible engineer feat to cram beefy hardwares into a slim laptop.

## First impressions

Every new Mac that came out since I have obtained the 15" MacBook Pro were kinda unusually meh because I felt they were minor to major leaps in hardware. The TouchBar was unattractive for me because I like a physical function row and _that butterfly keyboard_.

Upon opening up the box, the first thing struck me was the sleek form factor that got my attention straightaway. How to turn on the Mac I wonder? All I had to do was open the lid, beautiful size screen, keyboard glowing, and the size of the trackpad got me smiling straightaway. The fun, let me rephrase that, the _serious_ fun is back.

Once I have set everything up, the first thing that macOS does is spotlight indexing the storage space and photo library annoyingly will start to ramp up the CPUs. It happened before on the previous Mac which there is nothing you can do.

## Multitasking

## Speakers

## Annoying quirks of macOS Catalina

+ Photo library, why is it such a hog on the storage space?


## Conclusion

The technological leap from the previous Mac to this is astounding.
