## Virtualization

If you happened to have a Apple Silicon's M1 chipset and you need to set up an x86 version of Windows / Linux. Qemu is a good (free!) solution to use and it requires some learning to get a virtual machine up and running. If you need a decent GUI wrapper, [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app) is ideal to use.

Be warned, running x86 OS can be slow to run which you need a lot of patience to wait. Check out [UTM's gallery](https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/) if you want to check out the ARM64 version of Windows / Linux.

For the brave, install UTM and run Windows XP... Go on, you know you want to.

## Raiders of the lost web

Put down your beverage and read [this incredible piece of writing by Adrienne LaFrance](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/10/raiders-of-the-lost-web/409210/) about how unstable the web is because things can vanish overnight without a trace. [Internet Archiveâ€™s Wayback Machine](Archive.org) may be our saviour, the question is how long can the information stay online?

## Site of the week

[Hemingway App](https://hemingwayapp.com) is one of the site that I try and use to reduce complexity in writing. Often now and then, we do end up with complete verbal diarrhoea. Excuse me while I try and break down the disorganised mess in my head when writing!
