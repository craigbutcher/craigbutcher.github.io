## Euro 2020

This week note is a day late thanks to the highs and lows of the Euro 2020 championship football tournament that came to an end yesterday. England has done incredibly well to get to the Finals. No matter what, they are such a formidable team and definitely leading the way for many games that is yet to come. We have the World Cup 2022 next year and that in itself is a bigger task.

## Wimbledon

Once again at the grassroot courts, Djokovic won the Men's single tennis. All eyes are on the new Wimbledon's Women's No. 1 tennis player - Ashleigh Barty - My other half was cheering with glee because of her Aussie genes...

## Olympics

It's going to be a strange one for The Games to be starting soon because of COVID-19 that is having a major impact in Tokyo, Japan. In my opinion, it should not have gone ahead until it is completely safe to participate.

## And finally...

It's difficult to adjust to normality. Heck, there is no normal anymore! Thankfully, the sports being shown on TV in the past few weeks has been a great escapism from reality. From next week, the lockdown restrictions is to be removed - apart from _some_ restrictions to stay in place - there is a question if the UK government are doing the right thing. The anxious level in the United Kingdom is diabolical at this point.

All we have to do is to remember to take care ourselves and find ways to adapt.

Stay safe, tend to your plants in this warm summer breeze.
