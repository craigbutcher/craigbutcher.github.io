## Links ahoy!

Reddit can be such an informative website and I was fortunate to come across this monster of a thread - [What are underrated websites and what do you use them for?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/k213qf/what_are_underrated_websites_and_what_do_you_use/). I have spent a good amount of time reading the thread and noticed the best sites are...

+ [Remove Image Background](https://www.remove.bg) - It is in the title. It is an impressive tool on the web for removing backgrounds from your images. It is up there next to [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com).
+ [WindowSwap](https://www.window-swap.com) - This is a lovely website where you get to view other peoples' window on this planet. May it be in India, Australia, France, to name a few. Most of the videos as I have looked are on a loop yet it is so relaxing to look at.
+ [PhotoPea](https://www.photopea.com) - Hold up, a photoshop style app in a browser? Who knew that a browser can be doing this, the web browser has evolved enough for this to be featured.
+ [PointerPointer](https://pointerpointer.com) - Point and it will search an image that...er... point back at you?
+ [Terrible Real Estate Agent Photos](https://terriblerealestateagentphotos.com) - Worth a look and guarantee a good laugh.

Whew, what a nice rabbit hole of links to dive into!

## Brutalist websites

When dealing with website designs, sometimes it is great to break off from the norm and look at [Brutalist websites](https://brutalistwebsites.com). The idea of this exists in [Brutalist architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist_architecture) of minimalist design and material. It can often look draconian in parts developing huge and strange buildings that possibly stand the test of times.

Websites are like that, sometimes the old ones still lurks around and is functional - accessibility can thrive better in my opinion - yet informative. Sometimes it can create a pang of nostalgia. The simple times of the web may have been long gone yet various parts of it exists in a evolve form.

## Paper planes goes zoom

The other evening, my youngest son asked me about paper planes and how we can make interesting ones. A quick trip to YouTube brought up the one and only neat video. Currently at 8.2 million views, [how to make a best paper airplane jet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHglySrR5vs), it took a bit of fiddling with the folding yet the results has to be seen for yourself and requires bigger indoor spaces.

## And finally...

On the edge of science and technology, [Scientists develop an ‘electronic skin’ that can mimic the natural functions of human skin](https://sciencemint.com/scientists-develop-an-electronic-skin-that-can-mimic-the-natural-functions-of-human-skin/). We are edging closer slowly towards a true cyborg body aka Ghost In The Shell style, what will this mean for humanity? Will we need a [Voight-Kampff test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umc9ezAyJv0)?

Stay safe, tiers be damned.
