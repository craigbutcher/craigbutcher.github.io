Looking after your mental health will no doubt will be at the forefront of your mind, and remember to look after yourself whenever you can. Do not let the bullshit seep into your well-being as much as you can.

Although, the Empire series looks like a good starting point in the [chronological order mentioned on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series#Asimov's_novels_set_in_the_greater_Robot/Empire/Foundation_universe). There is a sense where is humanity is going next and did we ever pass the [Great Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter)?
