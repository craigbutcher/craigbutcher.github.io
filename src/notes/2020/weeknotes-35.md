## Time off

The last week of August is over and done. Most of the time it was being with my sons (while my other half working for the NHS as a phlebotomist) and DIY around the house that never seems to end! A lot of reflections occurred on my family, house, use of tech, and generally keeping check on my mental health.

There was a dip in the middle of the week when I felt that feeling the [black dog](https://www.time-to-change.org.uk/blog/managing-black-dog-depression) was back and because we are still in a global pandemic, the feeling of having time off during this unorganised chaos was unusual to deal with because of conflicted issues of "Should I be working from home? Why am I having a crisis with this?".

Thankfully, talking about it helps with family and friends. We are in the new normal, life is changing around us at a fast pace, and we must remind ourselves that everything is okay.

## Ungoogled Chromium

This week I have been mostly testing [Chromium sans integration with Google](https://ungoogled-software.github.io) web browser. It is impressive how they are prevent google's services and this will satisfy the privacy crowd. This browser fork was found via [No More Google](https://nomoregoogle.com/) which has an extensive list of services if you need to wean yourself away from Google.

The browser engine landscape is getting smaller due to [Mozilla cutting back on staff](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/08/firefox-maker-mozilla-lays-off-250-workers-says-covid-19-lowered-revenue/). 250 jobs are going which will hamper Firefox development. We do not need this happening because having competition is healthy.

## Magic

I was introduced to this [A Story about 'Magic'](http://catb.org/jargon/html/magic-story.html) after discussing about the infamous [turbo button](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_button) that featured on older PCs. It's an amusing geeky story to read and it somewhat led to a retro flashback talk about [3DFX graphic cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3dfx_Interactive), [SLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scan-Line_Interleave), and [Intel 80486 OverDrive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80486_OverDrive). Yes, I'm in my 40s if you must know...

## And finally...

RIP - [Chadwick Boseman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chadwick_Boseman).

Stay Safe. Happy Incoming September.
