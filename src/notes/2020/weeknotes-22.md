## Ultra-wide

On the back of last week with the [new MacBook Air](https://craigbutcher.io/notes/2020/weeknotes-21/), the next buy? Ultra-wide monitor. A quick look and research, I have settled on an [ilyama 34" ultra-wide](https://iiyama.com/gb_en/products/prolite-xub3493wqsu-b1/). Upon setting it up, I immediately thought "Did I make the right call because this is a whopper...", upon plugging it in, a nice 3440 x 1440 (2K) on tap with crisp and clean typography and graphics popped up and it was the correct decision.

It is nice to go back to one screen desktop. Less is indeed more.

## NASA and SpaceX

Since the scrubbed launch from Wednesday 27th May, the go ahead happened last night to launch.

We huddled on the sofa watching the incredible live scenes of SpaceX's Falcon 9 and the Crew Dragon spacecraft sitting on the top where Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley is, roaring away to space. That must have been one heck of a rollercoaster to ride from the start, and today? They have successfully docked with the International Space Station (ISS) and after a few hours, they have emerged to join the crew.

What is awesome is the futurist space suits they are wearing, the control panels are touchscreen (with manual override controls underneath as it seems), and how roomy was spacecraft? Go and take a look over at [NASA's Launch America for more details](https://www.nasa.gov/specials/dm2/).

Have a play with [SpaceX's ISS sim](https://iss-sim.spacex.com) where you can do docking with the ISS. Hats off to the experts who can get it right the first time.

## Leaving SASS

From the trenches of the Front End Web Developer, I have been using [SASS](https://sass-lang.com) for a while and it is great for what it is. With recent and rapid changes happening with CSS itself, such as custom properties, calc(), and recently, [clamp()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp). After reading [Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com/)'s post about [Sass and clamp](https://adactio.com/journal/16887), it made me rethink if I should ditch SASS in entirely.

To be fair, I have been coding in 'Vanilla' CSS lately and it's refreshing to return to that again. One thing I'm happy about SASS was that it taught me about [SASS DRY principles](https://alistapart.com/article/dry-ing-out-your-sass-mixins/) (it is applied everywhere in coding) among other useful mixins. Thanks for the memories, it's time to move on.

## And finally...

Hey... The world is a scary place right now. Take a look at [Bill Hicks' - It's Just A Ride](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqv8Os-AdUo) and know that we can change the world anytime we want.

Stay safe. Really.
