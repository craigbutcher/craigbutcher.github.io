## Wetware patches

Wetware is a great terminology for the human brain. Currently it is, or I am struggling with many things at the moment. The lockdown is having an odd effect on myself when working from home starts to blur the lines. From tomorrow, I'm taking on a strict regime in order to preserve my mind with work. So that's ``patch-wfh-wetware-november-week-one-fix.c`` sorted then!

## Pi replacement

Back in the first week of August, [I wrote about replacing the current Pi server](https://craigbutcher.io/notes/2020/weeknotes-32/) and was still on the fence for a while. The temptation of getting the Pi 4 8GB model made me question the following:

+ Can it run docker?
+ Is ARM still widely supported?
+ How hot will it run?

Suddenly, I'm automatically heading over to the x86 area where my needs are stronger there and already begun looking at mini-itx or possibly a second hand mac mini that I can run Linux on.

## NaNoWriMo - week one

3397 words so far in a space of three days.

I could have been up around 12,904. With a demanding family life (being a deaf parent is exhausting), work, and a mental health that has taken a beating. Interesting though that I have discovered a trigger that has prevented myself from writing for my blog for nearly five years. Week notes is a step ahead to get back into writing.

I will try my best to complete NaNoWriMo yet right now, it's too challenging to pay my full attention too at the moment.

## And finally...

Happiness arrives at last. Biden won the U.S Election and the world can breathe a little more.

Stay safe, do something new.
