## London CSS - Endless Summer

It was a great little online conference and it went off without a hitch. Whoever was doing the captioning on the night, you have gained many new love from people who cannot believe the speed of the text flying across the screen. Much respect!

[Stephanie](https://thinkdobecreate.com) shows off [Style Stage](https://stylestage.dev), [Cassie](https://www.cassie.codes) demonstrated painting with SVG, and the talk of the evening was [Adam Argyle](https://nerdy.dev) about what's up and coming in CSS.

There was a lot to take...err.. home about and there is this energy that went around virtually which was a much needed boost for our lockdown fatigue.

## Style Stage

On the back of London CSS this year, [Style Stage](https://stylestage.dev) is a nod to [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) as described:

> Style Stage seeks to rekindle that spirit by providing this page as the base HTML for contributors - like you! - to re-style by submitting an alternate stylesheet.

CSS Zen Garden was a great way of demonstrating CSS and understanding how it is constructed. It took myself a while to understand the potential and how to design website properly. Style Stage looks like something I can do in my own time to have fun designing for the heck of it.

## The Caretaker

[The Caretaker - Everywhere At The End Of Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJWksPWDKOc) - as a friend passed me this to listen to. I was told to listen to it for the experience and I think this will be a worthy test for the cochlear implant. Warning, read the content before playing because this is not going to be your average kind of easy listening tunes.

## And finally...

[Poolside FM](https://poolside.fm) launched their [app](https://poolside.fm/app) on iOS and macOS. There is the unique factor of how good this app is because it takes on the old look of macOS from the 80s, mish-mashed with vaporwave colours, and... Why don't you discover it for yourself? The website is absolutely spot on too.

Stay Safe. Have some cake.
