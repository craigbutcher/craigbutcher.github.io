Thinking about topics for this website has created a list that procrastination itself would have devoured endlessly and mock the mind saying "_You do love making lists and you will never get this out into the world!_".

Not this time around because I have settled down on the following:

+ Front End Web Development
+ Accessibility
+ Mental Health

To break down the list above, these are strong subjects that I talk about the most because I give a shit about it.
Posts written of the following will be in short or long form. There will be absolutely no TL&semi;DR nonense.

<h3>Front End Web Development</h3>

After working in the front end headspace for over a decade and admittedly being a grouchy old fart when it comes to new fangle frameworks in about everything. Web Standards has slowly went gone off track for everyone and here we are, fighting the good fight to bring _standards_ back into things. Bit like common sense with a bionic upgrade.

<h3>Accessibility</h3>

You have no idea how much bullshit there is out there on this planet when it comes to accessibility. It is not only tied to the web. It is everywhere. Expect Captain Picard's face palm GIFs among other caches of madness.

<h3>Mental Health</h3>

There is no hiding here, it is on the rise and we need to protect our mind. My experience are my own and it's a personal journey that I would like to share with the web. The hope is that if you see something similar experience you are going through, in limbo, or found peace / absolution, please always remember to seek help and advices from friends and family.

Surely you are keen to know what other things that didn't make the list:

+ Creative Swearing
+ Being Deaf and how to get away with everything (what?)
+ Generally nonsense
+ British weather
+ Far too many other things, there was a line written down "Talk about ants". I lost an hour researching into this,
