I have been trying to write the greatest start to this first blog post after six years out of blogging / writing. Mostly everything is captured into snippets on my notes.app, the annoying yet thankful friends waiting for me to get started on my site again.

So here it is, the start of writing once again. You may have noticed (was it obvious?) that the site is starting from scratch, no styles, no javascript, nothing. Let the text flow from the beginning and to the end of your browser width while the styling comes in over the course of this month.

Tomorrow, I will be talking about topics for this website and what do they mean for myself.

Happy 2020 all!
